# Classic-Leaderboard-UI
It is **essential** to disable the "ResetOnSpawn" property in the ScreenGui aswell as reading line 3 or else this will not work correctly

## Implementation
Option 1: Create a LocalScript and parent it to a ScreenGui under StarterGui

Option 2: Download and drag the "ClassicLeaderboardUI.rbxm" file into Roblox Studio and drag the ScreenGui that appears (likely in Workspace) into StarterGui

## Details
Brings back the classic Roblox leaderboard UI from pre-2020 with working functionalities such as friend requests, blocking users, stat display, etc
